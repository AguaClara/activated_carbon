        "The Activated Carbon Subteam aims to find if the use of activated carbon would be efficient to use in AguaClara water treatment plants and if so, calculate an optimal dosage of activated carbon. This is the fourth semester that this team is included as a part of AguaClara's Particle Removal and Dissolved Species Subteams. This semester, the team is aiming to do more research into the incorporation of activated carbon for our system and how effective it is in forming more densed flocs, which can contribute to the removal of humic acid and natural organic matter in general. In the future, Activated Carbon hopes to ultimately upscale the process so that it can be implemented in AguaClara plants.\n",

        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "Activated Carbon's goal is to find a new and efficient way to implement the use of activated carbon before the flocculation unit process to improve the efficiency of the AguaClara water treatment plants. This research will expand the mission of providing safe water on tap because it is based off of a new design where both powdered activated carbon (PAC), as a filtrant, and polyaluminum chloride (PACl), as a coagulant, would be used to remove particles. The reason that this area is being researched is that coagulant is not very efficient at binding to and removing organic matter in drinking water. Activated carbon is used in many household drinking water filters and fish tank filters to remove harmful organic molecules in the filtration step of the water treatment process and to increase the clarity and potability of the water. If this process is found to be viable, it is important for the process to be scaled up so that it can be used in larger scale plants and not just in the lab setting. If the use of a mixture of activated carbon and polyaluminum chloride is found to be an efficient process, it could revolutionize the efficiency of the AguaClara plants and be used further in other water treatment plants.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this research, humic acid will be used as a contaminant as humic acid is commonly present in groundwater at concentrations ranging from under 1mg/L to 30mg/L, and its removal is a relevant problem in wastewater treatment due its potential for forming carcinogens during disinfection and chlorination (Grzegorzek & Majewska-Nowak 2017). Humic acid also has a brown color and therefore, ultraviolet spectrophotometry in addition to turbidity may be used to determine the clarity of the water. The Activated Carbon Subteam is building on the work of the Humic Acid Subteam by using the values of the optimal coagulant dosage that the Humic Acid Subteam had found previously. The values of wavelength of maximum absorbance of humic acid will also be used to construct a calibration curve and use data from a spectrophotometer. The Activated Carbon subteam is essentially expanding upon the work of the Humic Acid  team and is trying use a new type of flocculation system to find an optimal coagulant dosage and powdered activated carbon dosage.\n",

        "## **Literature Review**\n",
        "PAC is commonly used in water treatment for the removal of dissolved organic compounds. Applying PAC to a floc blanket reactor (FBR) system that removes atrazine, Campos et. al. conducted experimental trials that measured the steady-state removal of atrazine against different dosages (2mg/l, 4mg/l, and 8mg/l) of PAC. Their results indicated that the dosage of 8mg/l was able to achieve the highest average atrazine removal rate of 93% (Campos et. al. 2000). The effects of carbon dose and hydraulic loading rate on carbon concentration and carbon retention time (CRT) in the floc blanket were also evaluated. As reported, for a PAC dose of 10mg/l, a reduction in the CRT from 25 to 10 hours resulted in an increase in the hydraulic loading rate from 1 to 1.5m/h, which has important engineering implications since this result suggests that a decrease in CRT may reduce PAC absorption efficiency (Campos et. al. 2000). Thus, careful considerations must be made when deciding on process flow rates during experimental trials since varying the residence time in the upflow blanket reactor may result in a less desirable PAC absorption efficiency.\n",
        "In terms of methods of application, PAC is most generally applied in water treatment plants at the rapid mix unit in order to provide enough absorption time as the water flows through the flocculation and sedimentation units. According to a report published by the National Research Council (US) Safe Drinking Water Committee, although PAC has conventionally been used to treat organic compounds that cause offensive taste and odor, large molecules such as humic acid diffuse slowly, and it is very likely that absorption equilibrium cannot be achieved in the available residence time of the carbon (National Research Council 1980). In addition, when PAC is applied to water containing chlorine, the carbon will act as a reducing agent, which will increase the required chlorine to achieve disinfection. These results concern a system that may not involve efficient removal of PAC after the sedimentation unit, thus more research is recommended to determine whether or not a PAC and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) conjoined system is justified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examining a more recently published article written by Tomaszewska et. al. suggests promising results from a PAC and PACl conjoined system. Jar tests simulating a water treatment system using PAC and PACl (coagulant) to remove humic acid and phenol were conducted with two different methods of process performance: (1) coagulant was added after 60-min adsorption on PAC and (2) coagulant and PAC were added simultaneously. Results suggested that the former method was more desirable: when the adsorption was conducted before coagulation, not only was a more complete removal of phenol achieved, flocs also exhibited a greater surface, which enlarged their settleability (Tomaszewska et. al. 2004). The article concluded that the effectiveness of organics removal by coagulation without the addition of PAC was much lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "After reviewing a recent paper by Zhen Wu et. al. that denoted the effect of kaolin clay in aiding the removal of humic acid in water, concentrations of stock solutions for jar tests were determined. The research paper suggested that the effectiveness of clay in removing humic acid is optimized when PACl is deficient (Zhen Wu et. al 2020). However, upon adapting the concentration values for our jar test, the concentration of PACl was increased on the basis that activated carbon was not tested on its ability to replace or subsidize PACl in our experiment. Besides, all other concentrations except that of PAC were calculated based on the values suggested by the paper. We are planning to run another jar test based on this article and another titled “Coagulation and Flocculation in Water and Wastewater Treatment” from IWA Publishing, which give preliminary concentrations which we could use to simulate our experiment on a smaller scale."

        "As of Spring 2020, Activated Carbon became a new addition to the Dissolved Species Removal Research Teams of AguaClara Cornell. The Activated Carbon subteam was established on the basis that a PAC and PACl conjoined system within upflow blanket reactors (FBRs) could reduce retention time and lead to more efficient removal of dissolved organic compounds within AguaClara’s current water treatment process, producing higher quality water with potentially lower cost. Due to similarities in the nature of experimental work carried by the Activated Carbon and Humic Acid subteams, results and experimental models from previous Humic Acid subteams can be examined and used but with an additional consideration of introducing PAC into the experimental setup.\n",
        "The Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 Humic Acid sub-teams identified optimal coagulant dosages for 5mg/L and 10mg/L HA concentrations (shown in Table 1 below), which could be referenced in testing for the optimal dosage ratios of PAC to coagulant for specific HA concentrations. In addition, the Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam found that as HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down slightly. However, the team cannot conclude that increasing HA concentration will decrease the optimal coagulant dosage, as this does not follow Beer's Law. This suggests that wider ranges of HA concentrations should also be tested for its optimal PAC to PACl dosage ratios for a more comprehensive analysis.\n",

They found that flocs did in fact form, however, they were too small to form a floc blanket, and thus, the effluent water’s absorbance value was not as low as anticipated. Due to those results, this semester, our team’s goal is to investigate whether activated carbon is a more suitable method of removing humic acid from water that does not have clay.\n",

Table 4 contains the comparisons in textures of PAC  using different methods The procedure for the most optimal method was included in the procedure section.\n",

To investigate the underlying reason for lack of floc formation, the team carried out a simple jar test with various powdered activated carbon concentrations. The concentrations of the solutions used are included in Table 5. As shown in Figure 3, the test was inconclusive since no flocs were formed and no visually significant difference could be observed, likely due to the extremely small concentrations of activated carbon and insufficient time for complete mixing and sedimentation.

After running for 1 hour, the influent and effluent turbidities were found to be 0.00 NTU. After checking that the calibrated turbidimeters were functioning properly, it was confirmed that the turbidimeter was not sensitive enough to detect the turbidity of a 0.2 g/L of humic acid solution.

With a standard flow rate of 1 mL/s H2O and 0.2 mL/s of all added compounds, this yields a concentration of 0.25 g/L humic acid and 0.625 g/L activated carbon in the flocculator. With these values, an influent turbidity of 8.5 NTU and an effluent turbidity of 25 NTU were observed with small flocs forming.

The high influent turbidity reading was also questionable and needs to be validated in the future.

        "Some challenges we faced occurred due to the fact that it had been roughly two years since anyone had performed lab work due to COVID-19. This gap led to uncertainty in regards to which equipment was available to us (e.g., a spectrophotometer to analyze effluent water) and time spent purchasing some much needed calibration equipment for our turbidimeters. Also, we had trouble identifying the concentrations of many solutions because they were either unlabeled or mislabeled, which hindered our ability to run experiments because we had to prepare all new solutions for testing. Most recently, we had difficulty running experiments because the water was shut off in the lab. These challenges helped us realize that we needed to become more diligent with our lab procedure, which was a key reason we decided to develop the SOP and recommend that there should be an MNC next year serving as a crash course on AguaClara lab procedures.\n",

        "In terms of future work for the Activated Carbon subteam, the plan is to begin trials by testing different powdered activated carbon doses in removing humic acid. Since the entire group does not need to be in the lab while the system is running, the subteam can meet in pairs multiple times a week to efficiently gather data. While in the lab, members should continue to adjust the flow rates in case too much activated carbon or humic acid is present in the sedimentation tube. Also, the subteam should receive the ideal coagulant dosage recommended by the Humic Acid Subteam because their focus is on that particular chemical. Furthermore, members can add small amounts of clay to simulate particles that are present in real water. If time allows, future subteam members could also test the effectiveness of activated carbon on real raw water from the nearby water treatment plant and also test biochar, a carbon skeleton of biomass that is more available in Central America, if PAC proves to be effective.\n",

        "This semester, the team has successfully connected our PAC pump to the system and ProCoDa, so the activated carbon solution can now be added into the influent stream along with humic acid, before going into the influent turbidimeter. Additionally, we have located and addressed the problem of wastewater not being carried up the wastewater tube by adding two additional pumps, one connecting to the end of the sedimentation tube, in order to remove the flocs, and one connected to the effluent turbidimeter, which is not necessary but is there in case the effluent water does not leave the system as it should. The latter effluent pump is controlled manually and has been confirmed to be effective at pumping the water up the wastewater tube. We have prepared the appropriate humic acid solutions, calibrated our turbidimeters, and have witnessed flocs in the sedimentation tube. A standard operating procedure was compiled, detailing the steps required to run the lab setup. Two jar tests have also been conducted to explore the effects of varying the concentrations of PAC on floc formation. No visible flocs were observed for the first jar test, while flocs formed for the second test, most visibly for the jar with 1 g/L PAC,  less so for 0.1 g/L and none for the version with 0.01 g/L PAC. After running trials with different PAC concentrations, a consistent decreasing trend for the effluent turbidity readings was observed while that for the influent water stayed largely constant. This is an indicator that flocs have formed and were removed from the water by the system. Our future work will be centered around finding the optimal, which would be the minimal effective, dosage of activated carbon and determining its effectiveness in removing humic acid.\n"
