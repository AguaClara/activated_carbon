## Abstract

The Activated Carbon Subteam aims to find if the use of activated carbon would be efficient to use in AguaClara water treatment plants and if so, calculate an optimal dosage of activated carbon. This is the first semester that this team is included as a part of AguaClara's Particle Removal and Dissolved Species Subteams. In the future, Activated Carbon hopes to ultimately upscale the process so that it can be implemented in AguaClara plants.
